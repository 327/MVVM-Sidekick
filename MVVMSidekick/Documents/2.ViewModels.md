#MVVM-Sidekick View Model (Part 1)

##1.View Model Types

###1.1. BindableBase

BindableBase(MVVMSidekick.ViewModels.BindableBase) is is a common base class of Data Models.

####1.1.1 Decalration:
	
In class file, type `classvm` +`[Tab]`+`[Tab]` Choose `Data model` and `[Tab]` again. Code below will be generated.

``` csharp

    //[DataContract(IsReference=true) ] //if you want
    public class SomeBindable : BindableBase<SomeBindable>
    {
        public SomeBindable()
        {
            // Use propery to init value here:
            if (IsInDesignMode)
            {
                //Add design time demo data init here. These will not execute in runtime.
            }

        }
        //Use propvm + tab +tab  to create a new property of bindable here:

    }   

```

*You can modify class name when the snippet highlight is still active and `[Tab]` again.*
	
*In these lines you can see a condition `IsInDesignMode` is involved. If `IsInDesignMode` is true, you can add some sample data / place holder  into properties. You can use this condition to make sure events and subscriptions will not work in designers. **This can protect your IDE from unhandled-exception-shutdown.***


####1.1.2 Add a property 

 	In this class,  type `propvm` +`[Tab]` +`[Tab]` Lines below will be generated.

``` csharp

        public int MyProperty
        {
            get { return _MyPropertyLocator(this).Value; }
            set { _MyPropertyLocator(this).SetValueAndTryNotify(value); }
        }
        #region Property int MyProperty Setup
        protected Property<int> _MyProperty = new Property<int> { LocatorFunc = _MyPropertyLocator };
        static Func<BindableBase, ValueContainer<int>> _MyPropertyLocator = RegisterContainerLocator<int>("MyProperty", model => model.Initialize("MyProperty", ref model._MyProperty, ref _MyPropertyLocator, _MyPropertyDefaultValueFactory));
        static Func<int> _MyPropertyDefaultValueFactory = null;
        #endregion      
	
```

*You can modify property type and property name when the snippet highlight is still active and `[Tab]` again.*







####1.1.3 Best practice

- Bindable base is usually for data model. 
- It usually need to be serialized or be deserialized, so please don't wire any property change observable in this class's constructor. 
- If your want to subscribe some property, please do it in the View Model and make sure the subscription disposable object is *disposed with* the View Model. (see [DisposeWith() extension method](#disposewith) part)
- Add commands in a data model is not prohibited but this usually cause confusing. Commands are more UI related but in several advance cases you might need commands in data model, like context menu models, but this is not good when you are not sure about what you are doing in most cases.


###1.2 ViewModelBase

`ViewModelBase` inherits `BindableBase` and it is usually been directly binded to a `FrameworkElement`. In that case commands are recommended to place here.

`ViewModelBase` has more member such like `IsUIBusy` for UI state control, and it has a method `WaitForClose()` that returns a task which will not start until the view is closed. The task can be awaited or continued with other task and logic, so a work flow among views is possible.


####1.2.1 Decalration:
You can add a View model with "View with View Model" Item template, or use snippets just like BindableBase `classvm` + `[Tab]`  then chose view model and `[Tab]` again.

``` csharp

  	//[DataContract(IsReference=true) ] //if you want
    public class SomeViewModel : ViewModelBase<SomeViewModel>
    {
        public SomeViewModel()
        {
            // Use propery to init value here:
            if (IsInDesignMode)
            {
                //Add design time demo data init here. These will not execute in runtime.
            }


        }

        //Use propvm + tab +tab  to create a new property of vm here:
        //Use propcmd + tab +tab  to create a new command of vm here:


    }
```

*You can modify property type and property name when the snippet highlight is still active.*





#### 1.2.2 Add a Command

A command usually defined in View Model as a Property, waiting to be bind to buttons and events. It usually have a resource key with it, but in `ICommand` interface this feature is not declared.

In MVVM-Sidekick A common model named `CommandModel` which implements `ICommand`, works as proxy. Via this `CommandMNodel<TCommand,TResource>` generic model, you can define couple any type of `ICommand` and any resource together.If you are using some other MVVM framework, the command may not be `ReactiveCommand` but a `DelegateCommand`, it works either.  

Think about image button, globalization button, and context menu cases, a `String` key is always necessary, at least, so we provide code snippets like below.




In class file, type `propcmd` + `[Tab]` +`[Tab]`, following lines will appear.

```csharp

     public CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String> CommandSomeCommand
        {
            get { return _CommandSomeCommandLocator(this).Value; }
            set { _CommandSomeCommandLocator(this).SetValueAndTryNotify(value); }
        }
        #region Property CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String> CommandSomeCommand Setup
        protected Property<CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>> _CommandSomeCommand = new Property<CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>> { LocatorFunc = _CommandSomeCommandLocator };
        static Func<BindableBase, ValueContainer<CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>>> _CommandSomeCommandLocator = RegisterContainerLocator<CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>>("CommandSomeCommand", model => model.Initialize("CommandSomeCommand", ref model._CommandSomeCommand, ref _CommandSomeCommandLocator, _CommandSomeCommandDefaultValueFactory));
        static Func<BindableBase, CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>> _CommandSomeCommandDefaultValueFactory =
            model =>
            {
                var cmd = new ReactiveCommand(canExecute: true) { ViewModel = model }; //New Command Core
                //cmd.Subscribe (_=>{ } ).DisposeWith(model); //Config it if needed
                return cmd.CreateCommandModel("SomeCommand");
            };
        #endregion

    }


```

*You can modify property type and property name when the snippet highlight is still active and `[Tab]` again.*

#### 1.2.3 Navigation

Navigation, means to change the view user is staring at.

A new view can be a control, a page or a window. It would be shown in place like desktop, frame or content control. The place to show a view is usually called `target`.  

In MVVM-Sidekick we use `Stage` name the `target` place, we can access `StageManager` property to show a new View Model in Command Logic.



``` csharp

        public CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String> CommandChangeMessage
        {
            get { return _CommandChangeMessageLocator(this).Value; }
            set { _CommandChangeMessageLocator(this).SetValueAndTryNotify(value); }
        }
        #region Property CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String> CommandChangeMessage Setup
        protected Property<CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>> _CommandChangeMessage = new Property<CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>> { LocatorFunc = _CommandChangeMessageLocator };
        static Func<BindableBase, ValueContainer<CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>>> _CommandChangeMessageLocator = RegisterContainerLocator<CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>>("CommandChangeMessage", model => model.Initialize("CommandChangeMessage", ref model._CommandChangeMessage, ref _CommandChangeMessageLocator, _CommandChangeMessageDefaultValueFactory));
        static Func<BindableBase, CommandModel<ReactiveCommand, String>> _CommandChangeMessageDefaultValueFactory =
            model =>
            {
                var cmd = new ReactiveCommand(canExecute: true) { ViewModel = model }; //New Command Core
                cmd.Subscribe(
                    async _ => {
                        var vms = await 
                            CastToCurrentType(model)
                            .StageManager
                            .DefaultStage
                            .ShowAndGetViewModel<NewRedPage_Model>();
                        var vm = vms.ViewModel;
                        vm.Message = "Hellow world again!";
                        await vms.Closing;
                        

                    }).DisposeWith(model); //Config it if needed
                return cmd.CreateCommandModel("ChangeMessage");
            };
        #endregion

```

`DefaultStage` means **current frame** in Page-Frame navigation, **new window** in window navigation, **content control** in control navigation. 

You can mark a  content control , a frame or a window to be a *`named stage`* via `StageManager.Beacon` dependency property , and you can access it with `StageManager["*stagename*"]`.

>*MVVM-Sidekick navigation based on View Model, and never need know view's detail. We shall discuss this later*

#### 1.2.4 Close View

Use `this.Close()` in view model, we can close the view bind to it, and continue the awaitable Task returned by `Stage.Show()`.
